## So you think you can post?

1. Clone or fork whole repo. 
2. Make branch with your post title: e.g. `git checkout -b mySuperCoolPost`
3. Open rStudio and make sure your current working directory is the blog repo. 
4. Run `blogdown::serve_site()` to make sure everything looks good.
5. Add a `.Rmd` to the `content/` directory and do your work there. (Blogdown should automatically rerender everytime you save.)
6. Once everything looks good submit a PR to the master branch of the main repo. 
7. Revel in the ones of twitter followers your new post gains you!
