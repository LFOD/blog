<p><em>Not So Standard Deviations is currently my writing muse (see <a href="http://www.lucymcgowan.com/hill-for-data-scientists.html">my inspiration</a> from their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-28-writing-is-a-lot-harder-than-just-talking">28th Episode</a>). This week, Roger Peng was discussing traffic data (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-29-standards-are-like-toothbrushes">listen here</a>), inspiring me to solicit some input on a weird result my colleague Ryan and I found this summer.</em></p>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This past August we won the Government Statistics Section JSM Data Challenge. <strong>We found that in mid-sized cars, vehicles that were in accidents with lower star ratings were more likely to have injured passengers (Figures 2 and 4).</strong> We delve into this further with an interactive scatterplot (Figure 5), allowing the user to examine the specific make and star rating of each car, along with the % of accidents with at least one injured passenger. You will notice there is certainly a sparsity of data in these lower-stare regions, in terms of types of vehicles, however they do represent a decent proportion of the weighted sample (201,239.8 (8.1%)).</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each year millions of new cars are sold in the US.</li>
<li>65% of new car consumers report that safety was their primary concern (Consumer National Reports Research Center, 2012)</li>
</ul>

<div id="saftey-ratings" class="section level4">
<h4>Saftey Ratings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Safety tests are conducted by the NHTSA on a subset of cars each year</li>
<li>Tests are conducted under highly controlled circumstances with test dummies in the driver and front passenger seats
<ul>
<li>frontal collision at 35 mph</li>
<li>side collision at 38.5 mph</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each car model tested subsequently receives (among others) an overall rating out of 5 stars.</li>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level4">
<h4>Data Sources</h4>
<ul>
<li>National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES) for the years 2011-2014
<ul>
<li>Maximum injury severity</li>
<li>Accident condition variables (weather, point of impact, type of accident etc.)</li>
<li>Passenger-level variables (age, sex, alcohol, seat-belt use, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NHTSA safety ratings (obtained from www.safercar.gov)
<ul>
<li>Overall safety rating</li>
<li>Weight of the vehicle</li>
<li><em><strong>Note</strong>: we obtained this data by scraping from the website; we attempted to contact NHTSA for a comprehensive list of ratings that was potentially more reliable than this method, but were not able to obtain one. Please let us know if you have access to this dataset!</em></li>

<div id="weighting-scheme" class="section level4">
<h4>Weighting Scheme</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nationally representative probability sample</strong> selected from all police-reported crashes.</li>
<li><strong>Eligibility</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A Police Accident Report must be completed for the crash</li>
<li>Crash must involve at least one motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway</li>
<li>Crash must result in property damage, injury, or death</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/master/figs/weighting-scheme.png" />

</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> is a sample of geographic areas, called Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), from across the United States. The NASS GES divides the United States into 1,195 PSUs.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2</strong> is a sampling of police jurisdictions within each PSU based upon probability proportional to the number of crashes investigated in a given jurisdiction. <em>An average of seven police jurisdictions have been selected within each PSU</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3</strong> is the selection of crashes within the sampled police jurisdictions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/master/figs/weighting-scheme-weight.png" />

</div>
<p>The weight is the product of the inverse of the probabilities of selection at each of the three stages in the sampling process.</p>

<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating the design in the statistical analysis is vital</li>
<li><p>In order to obtain the correct standard error estimates for a subpopulation, we need to properly account for the weights and design</p></li>
<li>All analysis was completed using <code>R</code></li>
<li>We primarily utilized the <strong>survey</strong> package:
<ul>
<li>T. Lumley (2014) “survey: analysis of complex survey samples”. R package version 3.30.</li>

<p>Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the injury &amp; safety ratings by weight class. Figure 2 shows the concerning result that 2-3 star rated cars in the mid-size weight class have proportionally fewer injuries. These results hold true after adjusting for the covariates, this result held true (Figure 4). <strong>Here is where we would love your input! Perhaps we missed an important confounder.

<div id="conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We have some evidence to show that ratings contribute to whether or not passengers are injured, however this relationship is complex.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level4">
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>This analysis was limited to vehicles that were in accidents – we don’t know the distribution of ratings in the general population</li>
<li>It is possible that 4 or 5 star cars are more likely to be rated than 2 or 3 star cars</li>
<li>Limiting ourselves to using ratings from 2011-2014 drastically decreased our sample size and limited the information about other cars involved in each accident</li>
<li>We were only able to observe 330 unique make/model/year combinations</li>
</ul>
